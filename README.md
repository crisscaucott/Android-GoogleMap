GoogleMap
=============================

This is a simple app using Google Map API that can display the device location (using [Location Services API](https://developer.android.com/training/location/)) in the map by tapping the tracking button. It can change the map type in the app-bar, which are: 
  * Normal: is a night mode terrain map, whose colors are provided by a JSON file that specifies how features in the map are displayed.
  * Satelite: is a satelite map.
  * Terrain: is a regular terrain map.
  
A blue marker it's placed by long pressing the map and a info window is show by clicking the marker.
For video purposes, the real gps location is faked using "Fake GPS Location app".
